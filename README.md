# CVHS Locker Backend

Node.js backend primarily developed by Marc Hyeler for a full-stack web application at CVHS, designed to manage locker
registration and administration. Built with Express.js and Sequelize ORM, it was designed with functional programming
principles in mind to ensure clean and maintainable code. This codebase handles admin authentication, locker
assignments, and
data management, tying together robust solution for locker management.

### What to do for dev setup:

1. clone repo
2. run ```npm i``` to install the node modules
3. run ```npm run sync-dev``` to create and sync the local dev db
4. run ```npm run start-dev``` to start the backend with the dev db
